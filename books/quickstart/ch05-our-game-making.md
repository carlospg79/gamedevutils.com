## Empty Project

The team of developers that maintains the MonoGame project has created a new repository for sample games. Their goals were set forth in a post to the MonoGame blog from Simon Jackson on April 17, 2014.

>... [T]he core MonoGame team set out with a purpose to being a new samples repository for the project. Its goals were simple:
   
>The samples had to be of high quality. They had to work on ALL platforms not just one. Best practices had to be used where possible. They had to be testable and re-usable to test the latest builds (builds may not pass if samples tests failed) ...

So, that sounds like a good place to start. When Simon posted the news item on the MonoGame website, there was a whopping one sample game -- `Platformer2D`. But one is all we need. The samples repository can be accessed from the following URL.

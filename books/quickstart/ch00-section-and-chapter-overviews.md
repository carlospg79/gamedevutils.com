# Part 1: Who? What? When? Where? Why?

To save time, and focus my efforts, this section of the book attempts to answer the questions that you may have about MonoGame. What is it? Why should I use it? Who maintains it? Where can my MonoGame creations be deployed?## Ch 1: History and Overview

There's a lot to learn in any new technology. And knowing what sparked the creation of the tech in the first place can be very handy in understanding the design decisions that went into its making. This chapter will explain the features of MonoGame, C#, and the .NET runtime. It will then tell you how they benefit you as a game developer.## Ch 2: Intro to C# and MonoGame

While not yet hands-on (that comes in the next chapter), this chapter will analyze the parts of a MonoGame game by dissecting the code that powers the simplest of games -- a cornflower blue screen that refreshes itself at 60 frames per second.# Part 2: How?

Hopefully all your questions were answered in the last section. All your questions, save one. How do I build a game in MonoGame?## Ch 3: Configuring Your Development Environment

MonoGame provides freedom in selecting your development environment. Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux are all supported. Pick one, then use this chapter to get things set up to build games.## Ch 4: Designing our Game

Every great game starts with a great design. That idea that's bouncing around in your head needs to come out in a somewhat organized way. So, we'll use this chapter to document the game we want to make. It's a puzzle game with RPG elements, based on one of my favorite mobile games - Puzzle and Dragons.## Ch 5: Building our Game

OK. It's time to get the nuts and bolts in place. In this chapter, we'll erect the scaffolding from which our game will be built. In the end, we'll have a puzzle game that is playable.## Ch 6: Making our Game More EngagingWith the puzzle mechanics out of the way, we can focus on the visuals and extras that make the game more appealing. When we're done, you'll think this is all we need to do, but there's still a key ingredient missing.## Ch 7: Adding RPG Elements

Remember that missing ingredient I mentioned in the last chapter? It's addiction. And we'll be adding it next. Recruiting helpers, growing their experience levels, investing time and effort in the game world. You in?# Part 3: Which?

This is the section of the book I would normally entitle "Popourri", but I've decided to stick with the question theme. So, there are a lot of options of where to take your game from here. And in this section will help you decide which direction to take.## Ch 8: Planning for the Future

When we added RPG elements to our game, we opened Pandora's Box. There's pretty much no limit to what you can add to a game where the characters evolve over time, and their foes evolve to match. Add a touch of "gotta catch'm all" collectability, and you have quite the addictive title on your hands.## Ch 9: Finding and Creating Assets

I dabble in art. I'm not the worst at it, but I'm certainly not the best. There are a ton of resources out there for reference (if you're bold enough to create your own content) or outright use - even in commercial titles. I'll tell you where some of the good stuff lives, and offer some advice for those who want to eventually sell their creations. For the more adventurous types, we'll discuss some of the free and cheap tools that you can use to churn out your own media assets for your game.# Part 4: Is That All?

So, you've made a game, eh? Now what? Want to make it faster? Want to port it to your phone? Want to sell it? This section touches on those topics, but does not attempt to serve as the definitive reference. Here, you'll get a nice overview along with some google fodder.## Ch 10: Platform Notes and AbstractionsTo be sure, building and running a game that you created on your laptop is cool. But there are only so many folks that can gather around that tiny screen when you want to show off your hard work. This chapter helps you get your masterpiece into the hands of your friends, family, and other players.## Ch 11: Optimizations

The first rule of fight club is that we don't talk about fight club. Similarly, the first rule of optimization is that we don't optimize. I know that sounds silly as the description of a chapter on optimization, but I want to make the point that you'll be crawling through a rabbit hole when you start on this task. Be sure to measure your performance before and after edits to make sure your "optimizations" actually made things better. And be sure to leave a trail of breadcrumbs so that you can find your way back.## Ch 12: Monetization

You're reading a book that was written by a guy who has never sold a game in his life. (If you don't count playable web ads or playable screen savers.) I'm a hobbyist. Game development is my passion. I don't code for the big bucks. But, I realize there are those of you who are more ambitious than I. For those souls, I'll cover some of the key concepts of packaging and pimping that make your game worthy of inclusion in fill-in-your-favorite-platform's store.
